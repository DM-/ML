% Now what I want to implement

%This section is for feedforward results finding

% A single neuron, takes data (row for sets, columns for variables) and weights (column) and activation function

% A layer of neurons, takes the same data as above, weights (each neurons weights take a column), derives size of net from weights and activation function

% A standard 3 layer network, takes data as above, weights arranged as above + 3rd dimension for each layer, derives size of net from weights and activation function

% An arbritary size network, data as above, weights as above, derives size as above, and activation function
